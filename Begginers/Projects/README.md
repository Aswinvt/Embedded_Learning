This is a set of codes done on ATMEGA32, PIC16f877A and LPC21XX during my learning period. It also contains the simulation files for proteus.

## Things to be noted
There won't be any format or comments in the program file. It might be updated in the future, for now its just a reference code for simulations and testings.

### Prerequisites

For simulation use proteus

For AVR platform use AVR Studio or Atmel Studio

For PIC platform use MPLAB IDE

For ARM platform use Keil uVision
